      I was born here. I was there 1.5 years at first. Then we came back a few years later in 2005 and stayed here for 5 more years

      I truly do not remember living here whatsoever. We were here for about a year. My parents said it was way too humid.

      <div class="fw-bold">Naples, Italy</div>
      We were sent here for a NATO assignment. I sorta remember living here. I have isolated memories like the taste of good italian food and going to the beach. Naples was described by the locals as a "beautful woman with dirty feet, once you get past the dirty feet, she is a beautiful woman." Fun fact: Italy has poor waste management systems.

      I did 4th-8th grade here. Being able to explore DC was super fun. I still go back to visit my friends here. It was technically a suburb even though DC was 30 minutes away. It was a great school system and I loved it here.

      This is where I reside now when I am not in school. This is where the Revolutionary War ended. The whole area is quite historic. We also have beautiful beaches. I miss the seafood when I am here. Yorktown is so green and lush, which is the opposie of Oklahoma. Highly suggest a visit here.

      Norman has never quite felt like home but we are getting there. I just bought a car over a year ago so I am exploring it now. It is an interesting mix of things and people.
